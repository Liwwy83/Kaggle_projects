# Digit Recognizer

This is my first attempt at convolutional neural network (CNN).

Using tensorflow keras, with 3 layers of Conv2D, 2 hidden dense layers and 1 output layer, with Batch Normalization and MaxPooling2D in between, an accuracy of over 99% was achieved on the validation set (split out from the training set) and a score of 0.99046 was achieved on the [Kaggle leaderboard](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/leaderboard).
